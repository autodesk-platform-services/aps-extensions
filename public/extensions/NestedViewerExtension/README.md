## Usage

- Load the extension in the viewer
- Click the <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/64/000000/picture-in-picture.png" width=16> icon in the toolbar
- New dialog will open, showing a dropdown list of all viewables available for the currently loaded model

## Setup

Include the CSS & JS file on your page. This CDN is compatible with the lastest Viewer version (v7).

```xml
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/autodesk-forge/forge-extensions/public/extensions/NestedViewerExtension/contents/main.css">
<script src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/autodesk-forge/forge-extensions/public/extensions/NestedViewerExtension/contents/main.js"></script>
```

After Viewer is ready, preferable inside `onDocumentLoadSuccess`, load the extension

```javascript
viewer.loadExtension("NestedViewerExtension", { filter: ["2d", "3d"], crossSelection: true })
```

## Configuration

The extension accepts an optional _options_ object with the following properties:
- `filter` - array of allowed viewable "roles" ("2d", "3d", or both), by default: `["2d", "3d"]`
- `crossSelection` - boolean flag for cross-selecting elements after they're selected in the main or the nested viewer, `false` by default

## How it works

The extension uses another instance of [GuiViewer3D](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/GuiViewer3D/)
and places it in a custom [DockingPanel](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/UI/DockingPanel/).
Whenever the "main" viewer loads a different model (observed via the `Autodesk.Viewing.MODEL_ROOT_LOADED_EVENT` event),
the extension collects all viewables available in this model (using `doc.getRoot().search({ type: 'geometry' })`),
and makes them available in the docking panel's dropdown.
